Design Principles:

The design principles that we wanted to adhere to in our web application were
visibility and feedback. Overall, we were designing a fairly simple 
application so ease of use and simplicity were our main goals. In terms of
visibility, from the homepage, every bit of functionality was evident and due
to simple wording, the user would be aware of what their actions could be.
There was a simple search box with clear directions and button that would
tell them what to expect upon taking action. In terms of feedback, we noticed
that there were times where a user may submit no search category, which would
lead to no action. A user may be confused since it appeared that the page was
loading. However, on the console an error was thrown. To remedy this, we would
redirect the user and provide an error message that they must submit some kind
of search value. In doing this, we managed to limit the ammount of confusion
for the user in our application with clear and concise feedback. Overall, the
design principles that we incorporated served as a way to make our application
as minimalistic as possible so that any user could use it with no guidance or
assistance.
